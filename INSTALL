    If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass

            % cpanm -S RDF::TrineX::Serializer::MockTurtleSoup

INSTALLATION WITH THE CPAN SHELL
    Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to
    do:

            % cpan RDF::TrineX::Serializer::MockTurtleSoup
